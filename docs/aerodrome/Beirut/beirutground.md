# 2. Beirut Ground


## 2.1 General Provisions
Beirut Ground is responsible for handling all ground movement on Rafic Hariri International
Airport’s aerodrome in addition to providing IFR and VFR flights proper clearances based on a
valid flight plan, valid route, and flight level.
In the event where the flight plan contains an invalid route or flight level, the ground controller is
responsible for correcting the error prior to issuing the clearance.


## 2.2 Departure Clearance

### 2.2.1 IFR Clearance
Beirut Ground issues IFR clearances for departing aircraft stated that they request their clearance
with the following information and under the following conditions:
- A valid flight plan with a valid route and requested flight level according to the direction of
flight (eastbound or westbound).
- Callsign
- Aircraft type
- Parking stand
- ATIS information
- Requested flight level
- Destination
- SID

### 2.2.2 IFR Clearance Issuance Format

The IFR clearance shall be expected to be issued in the following format:
- Callsign
- Controller identification (if initial contact)
- Destination
- Departure procedure
- Departure runway
- Flight planned route (identical to “as filed”)
- Initial climb
- Squawk code

!!! example
    **Controller**: “MEA374, BEIRUT GROUND, CLEARED TO JEDDAH VIA THE KAD2D DEPARTURE
RUNWAY 21, FLIGHT PLANNED ROUTE, INITIAL CLIMB 5,000 FT, SQUAWK 4301.”

A full readback shall be expected by the ground controller. If the pilot does not report the ATIS
information on initial contact, it shall be passed along with the QNH during the readback correct
phrase.


!!! example
    **Controller**: “MEA374, READBACK CORRECT, INFORMATION ALPHA, QNH 1017, ADVISE WHEN
READY FOR PUSHBACK.”

### 2.2.3 Aircrafts Requiring a Reroute

Aircrafts requiring a reroute are typically flight plans with invalid routes. Those flight plans will be
marked with a red or yellow “R” in their flight strip. In some cases, you may notice a red “X”
symbol which indicates that both the route and flight level must be checked.
In the event where the aircraft’s filed route is invalid, aircrafts must be rerouted before issuing
them the clearance. This can be done in one of two methods:
● Private message to the pilot which includes the new full valid route, or the part of the
route which has been modified.
● Issuing the clearance with the reroute over the frequency voice.

!!! example
    **Controller**: “MEA364, BEIRUT GROUND, CLEARED TO JEDDAH VIA THE KAD2D DEPARTURE
RUNWAY 21, ELIKA VELOX LAKTO, FLIGHT PLANNED ROUTE, INITIAL CLIMB 5,000 FT,
SQUAWK 4301.”

Aircrafts shall be informed of any anomalies in their flight plan as soon as they connect to the
network.


### 2.2.4 Aircrafts Requiring a New Clearance
Aircrafts may need to obtain a fresh clearance under circumstances such as a pilot's request for a particular runway or departure procedure different from the initially granted one, or in response to alterations in weather conditions resulting in changes to the runway setup.


!!! SCENARIO
    MEA364 was cleared to Jeddah via the KAD2D departure runway 21 with an initial climb of 5,000 FT and squawk 4301, then the pilot requests KAD2D departure runway 17

Instead of repeating the whole clearance again, the controller may provide a new clearance using
the following format:

!!! SOLUTION
    “MEA364, RE-CLEARED VIA THE KAD2D DEPARTURE RUNWAY 17, THE REST REMAINS UNCHANGED.”

In situations necessitating updated clearances because of weather and runway configuration changes, all aircraft on the stands and aprons must be issued new clearances in accordance with the previously mentioned format. However, aircraft that have already commenced pushback will adhere to their existing clearances and configuration.
